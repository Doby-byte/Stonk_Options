![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

A powerful web-based tool for analyzing S&P 500 stocks and finding optimal options trading opportunities, with a focus on Cash-Secured Puts (CSP) and Covered Calls strategies.

## üîç Overview

This application helps traders identify potential options plays by:

1. Fetching real-time stock data and options chains from Yahoo Finance

## Technical Documentation

### Architecture Overview

This application follows a client-server architecture with both components running locally:

- **Backend**: Python Flask server that processes data and serves API endpoints
- **Frontend**: HTML/JavaScript client that provides the user interface

### Core Components

#### Data Collection (`app.py`)

The application fetches data from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library:

- **Stock list**: Retrieved from Wikipedia or falls back to a static list
- **Price data**: Historical data for calculating technical indicators
- **Options chains**: Call and put options for various expiration dates

#### Technical Analysis (`app.py`)

Several indicators are calculated to assess stock conditions:

- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Momentum oscillator indicating overbought/oversold
- **Moving Averages**: MA50 calculation for trend identification
- **Fear/Greed**: Sentiment indicator derived from RSI

#### Options Analysis (`app.py`)

The heart of the application is the options analysis engine:

- **OTM Probability**: Calculated using implied volatility and normal distribution
- **Premium Per Day**: Normalizes premium by days to expiration for comparison
- **Classification**: "Best," "Better," "Good" categories based on risk/reward

#### API Endpoints (`app.py`)

The Flask server provides these key endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/` | GET | Serves the main application UI |
| `/api/refresh-data` | POST | Triggers a background refresh of stock data |
| `/api/data` | POST | Returns filtered options data for selected stocks |
| `/api/status` | GET | Reports current refresh status and progress |
| `/api/stocks` | GET | Returns the list of available S&P 500 stocks |
| `/api/independent-ai-recommendation` | POST | Returns AI-generated CSP recommendations based on current market data and risk tolerance |

#### Web Interface (`templates/index.html`)

The frontend provides an intuitive interface for:

- Stock selection with multi-select dropdown
- Parameter controls for filtering options
- Interactive data table with sorting and filtering
- Progress indicators for data refresh operations

### Key Algorithms

#### OTM Probability Calculation

```python
# Calculate probability (uses normal distribution approximation)
time_to_expiry = days_to_expiry / 365.0
log_moneyness = math.log(strike / current_price)

# Standard deviation for the move
std_dev = iv * math.sqrt(time_to_expiry)

# Z-score for the probability
z_score = log_moneyness / std_dev if std_dev > 0 else 0

# Probability of remaining OTM (above strike for calls)
otm_prob = norm.cdf(z_score)
```

#### Option Categorization

```python
def categorize_option(premium_per_day, otm_probability):
    if premium_per_day >= 0.40 and otm_probability >= 90:
        return "Best"
    elif premium_per_day >= 0.25 and otm_probability >= 90:
        return "Better"
    elif otm_probability >= 90:
        return "Good"
    return "Not Recommended"
```

### Data Flow

1. **Initialization**:
   - Load cached data if available and fresh
   - If no cache, wait for user to trigger refresh

2. **Data Refresh**:
   - User clicks "Refresh Data" button
   - Background thread fetches data for all S&P 500 stocks
   - Progress is reported via `/api/status` endpoint
   - Results are cached to `data_cache.json`

3. **Options Analysis**:
   - User selects stocks and sets filtering criteria
   - Frontend sends POST request to `/api/data`
   - Backend filters options based on criteria
   - Results are returned to frontend for display

### Performance Considerations

#### API Rate Limiting

Yahoo Finance imposes strict rate limits that can lead to "429 Too Many Requests" errors. This application implements a robust solution for handling these limits:

##### How the Rate Limiting Solution Works

- **Custom Browser Headers**: The application rotates through different User-Agent strings to mimic regular browser traffic instead of appearing as an automated script.
- **Session Management**: Uses persistent sessions with browser-like headers for all requests.
